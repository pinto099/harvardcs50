Intro to CS50

A lab’s instructions should be written in README.md (which must be in the same directory as .cs50.yml), using GitHub-flavored Markdown. Via CS50-specific “tags” can you add interactive features to those instructions. If present, each should appear on a line of its own but might very work in other contexts too (e.g., in ordered or unordered lists).

Your Markdown can also contain, if need, raw HTML, but not these tags.

Your Markdown can also contain emoji. :slightly_smiling_face:
